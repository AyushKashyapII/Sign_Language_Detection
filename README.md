# 🧠🤟 Sign Language Detection using ML & Live Camera Feed

This project aims to detect and recognize **American Sign Language (ASL)** hand gestures in real-time using a webcam feed and Machine Learning models. It provides an interactive way to translate hand signs into text, bridging communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
